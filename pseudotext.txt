* Try not to stress on the math portion whatsoever, it should go over fine. 


It opens with a greeting to the user and such, prompting them to enter the bill amount;

print("-----------------------------")
print("Welcome to the Tip Calculator!")
print("-----------------------------")
print("#############################")
print("#############################")

The bill should be a float!! decimal places, remember! 
The bill will also be an input from the user, as will the desired percentage of a tip. 

PERCENT = TIP. 

Use a variable here, just so the math can all math right. DO. NOT. OVER. COMPLICATE. IT.

bill = input(float("Please enter the bill amount here: "))

percent = input(float("Please enter the tip percentage here: "))

^ Two above led to ValueErrors, because those are strings. Strings are not floats. I am a mere jester for the court. 
Swapped those two around 



--------
Those variables will then be put into a formula, try following the formula word for word. 
Do not overcomplicate it. And note to myself; do not overcomplicate it with the uml or because of.


tip_percent = percent / 100 <- this makes it a DECIMAL, because when it's entered it'll be a whole number, and that's smelly 

Then, this will be plugged into the next formula; 

total_tip = bill * tip_percent 

Just one more variable;

total_bill = bill + total tip 

====
Formatting methods attempted for the decimal because 

{bill:.2f} <- Keeps saying invalid decimal literal, and I don't understand why (THAT IS THE RIGHT ONE.) and I do not 
know how to fix it.
Literally everything BUT that works.
